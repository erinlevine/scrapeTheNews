Using Mongoose and Cheerio, I created a very simple web application that allows users to find the latest chatter on the Big Brother Reddit Subreddit. 

Yes, I still watch Big Brother. Yes, it rules. Yes, I recommend you watch it. 

Users can not only see the latest posts from the subreddit, but they can leave a comment on each post and, alternatively, delete a comment on each post. 

This app uses:

- Express

- Mongoose

- Body-parser

- Cheerio

- Request
